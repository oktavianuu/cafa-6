Background:
- protein is large molecules
- composed of 20 types of smaller molecules known as amino acids.
- these amino acids are ordered in long chain called or known as the protein amino acid seq.
- each protein has its own unique seq. This unique seq determines its structure and function.

Goal: build a model that predicts what protein does based on its amino acid seq. 

Problem:
- We don't fully understand what many individual proteins do.
- current approach?
	- compare a protein to other proteins whose functions are known
	- search scientific papers for clues
	- use ml to analyze data from mult sources
	- the methods mentioned above are useful but struggle with complex biology because proteins have multiple roles and their functions can change depending on the situation.

what we need to do?
- train a model to predict gene ontology (GO)
- What is GO? it is a set of proteins based on the sequence of their amino acids.
- Go describes what the protein does, which biological processes it's involved in, and where int the cell it operates.
- we need to predict multiple labels at once while sorting trhough messy bio data. 

what if succeed?
- help scientists narrrow down protein roles faster
- prioritize lab exp
- spot connections that might otherwise get unclocked

REMEMBER: nowing what a protein does is a small step for a model, but a giant leap for medicine.
